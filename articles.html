                  <p>her own experience with that of hundreds of women to identify the biggest challenges and the best solutions that women face today. From VPs of Fortune 100 companies to entrepreneurs to women just starting their careers, she traces the patterns and themes underlying women's power, choices, love, sex, money, and many other vital topics for working women. Without sugar-coating the facts, preaching, or oversimplifying, she offers solutions and shares the truth about the working world: women's choices are limited, you can't have it all, women do work differently from men and, yes, it is possible to find success amidst all of this and feel good about it.</p>

                  <p>Failure hits you once again, what are you going to do? Run away, hide in your room, and never again put yourself out there because you simply can’t go on feeling like a total loser - rejected, embarrassed, and humiliated. For sure, if anyone else knew you failed, people will think less of you and or worse yet, give you a piece of their mind, “You aren’t going anywhere with your business idea; Go get a job and live your passion as a hobby; Your goals aren’t realistic; You’ve been working on your dreams for years… don’t you think it’s time you call it quits?” Maybe IT’S YOU who put your real dreams on hold because LIFE KICKED IN. Forget your dreams – you’re wasting your life away just trying to deal with the realities surrounding you. </p>

But so often the opposite happens, and they end up encumbered by businesses that bear little to no resemblance to those they had envisioned. They wind up working for their companies, but their companies don't work for them.</p>
