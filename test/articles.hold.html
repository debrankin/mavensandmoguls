                        <p>Failure hits you once again, what are you going to do? Run away, hide in your room, and never again put yourself out there because you simply can’t go on feeling like a total loser - rejected, embarrassed, and humiliated. For sure, if anyone else knew you failed, people will think less of you and or worse yet, give you a piece of their mind, “You aren’t going anywhere with your business idea; Go get a job and live your passion as a hobby; Your goals aren’t realistic; You’ve been working on your dreams for years… don’t you think it’s time you call it quits?” Maybe IT’S YOU who put your real dreams on hold because LIFE KICKED IN. Forget your dreams – you’re wasting your life away just trying to deal with the realities surrounding you.</p>
                        <p>You are about to read real stories of 18 individuals who continue to win in life because they didn’t allow failure to keep them captive in their rooms. They are proud, bold, and living their dreams full-on. If you feel life has gotten you down; that your past stops you from moving forward; that you are nowhere close to living the life you envisioned, sit-down, relax, grab a hot soothing drink, and read this book. Whoever told you that the road to success feels good was lying to you. Can you handle being rejected; told-no; embarrassed; and looked down upon? Are you willing to embrace failure EVERYDAY of your life in order to succeed? Learn how to say YES to your dreams in the midst of unpleasant feelings and emotions that make you want to hide from the world, and get ready to be taken on a journey where your own success depends on your willingness to fail.</p>
